  I began my career in education while still in college, tutoring for both Breakthrough Collaborative and the Simon
  Scholars Foundation, helping underserved middle and high school students in Santa Fe become the first college
  graduates in their families. I followed this path for five more years, eventually becoming a certified teacher
  in Dallas ISD and collecting a few fridge door's worth of student notes and letters along the way.

  Since then, I've spent the last 5 years working my way toward becoming a senior software engineer, doing everything
  from being the sole developer at a startup to leading cross-functional team efforts at iHeartMedia and VShift.
